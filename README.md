Plugin Name: Image Usage Tracking WordPress Plugin
Description: This plugin post activation, tracks media usage across all posts/pages with view counts in WordPress.

Was fedup with finding where all, the uploaded media was used, so needed a way to track it to sometime delete/update it - though I also wanted a way with which I can update the image without replacing the path, but not that much of a requirement, does the quick job for me.

Download as Zip, upload at your site & track the media üôÇ.
